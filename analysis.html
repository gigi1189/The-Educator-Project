        <h3 style="margin-bottom: 30px;">Interview Analysis:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Based on my interview, my educator demonstrates a deep understanding of the climate for
                LGBTQ+ students at their school, perhaps more so than any other staff member except the 
                counselor. This insight became clear when Danielle mentioned that the school counselor 
                essentially appointed them as a second counselor for LGBTQ+ students.
            </br>
            </br>
                Danielle is an active advocate for inclusive practices, consistently promoting the use 
                of correct names and pronouns and showing a thorough awareness of the school’s policies—or
                lack thereof—regarding LGBTQ+ students. They expressed a positive outlook 
                on the school environment for students with same-sex parents or those who identify as 
                non-heterosexual. However, they conveyed a more critical view regarding the climate for 
                transgender students.
            </br> 
            </br>  
                In terms of supportive practices, Danielle shows a strong commitment. They respect 
                student confidentiality, honoring their choice on whom to disclose their identities to. 
                They actively seek out professional development by attending workshops and events focused 
                on teaching LGBTQ+ youth, and they prioritize pronoun respect in their classroom. Notably,
                Danielle has called out discrimination when encountered, as seen in an incident where 
                they challenged a secretary who refused to use a student’s they/them pronouns. 
            </br>
            </br>
            </li>
            <li>
                As an LGBTQ youth who attended this school, I can confirm that sexuality and gender identity 
                are rarely discussed, which aligns with Danielle's statement that “They just pretend it’s not 
                real.” Based on the interview, there doesn’t appear to be open hostility, but queer students 
                generally don’t feel comfortable disclosing their identities. This is likely due to a lack of 
                normalization around LGBTQ+ topics, creating an environment of cis- and heteronormativity.
            </br>
            </br>
                While there is some representation, like a children's Harvey Milk biography, there’s nothing directly taught
                on LGBTQ+ topics. Danielle noted that students are generally indifferent to sexual orientation, 
                saying they “couldn’t care less” about topics like homosexual parents. However, transgender students 
                appear to face more negativity, perhaps due to their heightened visibility in traditional and social
                media. A member of the school board themself said they simply do not believe it exists, which shows
                the strained relationship many transgender youth have with their educators and authority figures. This
                idea that anything LGBTQ related should not be allowed in schools is a growing sentiment as reflected
                in  <a href="https://nypost.com/2022/04/20/science-shows-transgender-education-doesnt-belong-in-schools/" target="_blank">
                Science shows transgender education doesn’t belong in schools"</a> from the New York Post, which argues
                that many children do not feel gender dysphoria, and may be confused as a result of the teachings.

            </li>

            </br>
            <li>
                My educator shared that they use gender-neutral language for all students, which I think is great.
                Gender-neutral language can help both cisgender and transgender students feel included and validated.
                They also include historical figures who happen to be queer in their curriculum, 
                which is a great way to introduce young children from conservative backgrounds to diverse 
                walks of life. This aligns with the reading <a target="_blank" href="https://libguides.brooklyn.cuny.edu/ld.php?content_id=75747678">
                “Did it get better? The Reality of Queer and Trans Youth of Color in K-12 Schools,” </a>
                which advises teachers to “integrate LGBTQ- and 
                QTPOC-affirming lesson plans into their curricula – especially in states where such 
                practices are legal.”
            </br>
            </br>
                I’d recommend the school establish a visible safe space or GSA for LGBTQ+ students. An 
                openly advertised group could help students who might not realize they can reach out for 
                support or who may feel hesitant. As well as increased visibility on LGBTQ+ people in general.
                Normalization is an avenue to acceptance.

                To gain a more complete picture of the climate for LGBTQ+ youth at this school, 
                interviewing the guidance counselor mentioned by my educator could provide valuable 
                insights. Additionally, understanding parents' perspectives would be significant, 
                especially considering the current focus on parental rights and control over educational 
                content. Knowing what the parents in this community believe should be taught about LGBTQ+
                topics would reveal potential influences on school policies. Most importantly, hearing
                directly from LGBTQ+ students at this school would offer the most authentic view of 
                their experiences, though, as my educator noted, many may not feel comfortable being open
                about their identities in this environment.
