    <p class="question">  
        How long have you been in the field of education? 
        And how long have you been at your current school?
    </p>
    <p class="response">
        This is my 15th year and my 8th year at this school.
    </p>
    <p class="question">
        Where do you work?
    </p>
    <p class="response">
        At Aurora School in Aurora, West Virginia.
    </p>
    <p class="question">
        What's your role in the school?
    </p>
    <p class="response">
        On paper, the art teacher, but I also teach Spanish and musical theater.
    </p>
    <p class="question">
        How would you describe the overall situation for LGBTQ plus youth in your school?
    </p>
    <p class="response">
        There hasn't really been any kids that feel comfortable being openly out with everyone. 
        So it's hard to gauge, like, how other people would be. But I've had lots of kids tell 
        me and tell, like, a couple other teachers, and they're just, like, ‘Yeah I don't want 
        everyone to know yet though because, I'm not sure.’ I was like, ‘Yeah, man. That's on you.
        Thank you for sharing. I will not say anything.’ But there hasn't been any outwardly negative 
        yet. We'll see.
    </p>
    <p class="question">
        Have you ever received training or education specifically on issues related 
        to LGBTQ youth or families?
    </p>
    <p class="response">
        I have not. We have never been given any sort of, like, official training. Of course, I read 
        things and attend things at conferences on my own. But as far as being provided, we do not do that. 
        They just pretend it's not real.
    </p>
    <p class="question">
        Do you consider your school to be inclusive of transgender or gender nonconforming students?
    </p>
    <p class="response">
        No. I do not. I think that will be a thing when kids are like, 'No. That's not what I'm going to be called' 
        and their parents back them instead of parents that don't know and so then kids can't say 
        anything about it. But I got one in 5th grade. Told me they told their parents. I was like, 
        ‘What exactly did you come out with to your adults? Sorry. I'm just not sure, could go either 
        way here.’ And they're like, 'Oh, I'm non-binary.' I'm like, 'Oh, sweet! How'd it go?' They said, 'Well, 
        I texted them.' I was like, 'god forbid you walked downstairs.' 'Like, well, my mom said, 'cool. 
        Why are you awake? Go to bed.''
    </p>
    <p class="question">
        Are LGBTQ people history or events addressed or included in your school curriculum at all?
    </p>
    <p class="response">
        We did in fact order a lot of new books, and I did see there was this giant stack of, like, 
        kid versions of, biographies and Harvey Milk was in the stack. And I was like, 'okay? Alright. 
        So it's there. We're not pretending.'
    </p>
    <p class=question>
        But it's not, like, taught in the classes?
    </p>
    <p class="response">
        No.
    </p>
    <p class=question>
        But It's there. It's there.
    </p>
    <p class="response">
        But, yeah. There's at least some presence, but there's not any outward explanation. 
        But when teaching about artists I was like, ‘She was married to a man, but sometimes 
        had girlfriends and boyfriends and moving on. And then that's it.’ And they're like, ‘Oh, k.’
    </p>
    <p class="question">
        In your experience, how receptive are young students to learning about and 
        accepting families with 2 moms or 2 dads? So, homosexual parents. 
    </p>
    <p class="response">
        We have a kid in kindergarten who has 2 moms, and no one could care less. We're like, 
        'who's picking you up? Mom or mama?' They go, 'mama!' Alright.
    </p>
    <p class="question">
        How cute!
    </p>
    <p class="response">
        Yeah. So, so far so good.
    </p>
    <p class="question">
        How does your school handle dress code policies for children who might express their gender 
        differently than traditional norms?
    </p>
    <p class="response">
        Has yet to happen.
    </p>
    <p class="question">
        Are there incidents of educators or students refusing to respect a transgender youth's chosen 
        name or pronoun?
    </p>
    <p class="response">
        I have had that happen. It was at Rowlesburg, my other school. It was a couple years ago, 
        and I said ‘they’, and the secretary was like, 'you're talking about her, this girl', and I 
        was like, 'I was not? Actually, I'm sorry that only you know of one person who wants to be 
        called something differently, but there are 3 or 4 that I know of. - I'm sorry that they don't 
        trust you with that. And I will continue to use names that they want to be called because
        their adults aren't in my class. They are.' 
    </br>
</br>
        The parent who has come out as non binary, their wife posted a thing, and I was like, 
        'Oh my gosh. This is great. I think we should just use they/them with everyone, and then
        no one feels uncomfortable. And it's fine.' But another teacher at the school screenshotted 
        my response to a parent of our kids who's also an educator in the county and went to the 
        admin and said, 'If Claire's gonna try to call my kid a it, then she's got another thing 
        coming.' I was like, 'I'm sorry? No one said <span class="italics"> it</span>. I said
        <span class="italics">they/them</span>. Also, I've already been 
        doing it. You just don't pay attention to anything.'

        <p class="question">
            If and when bullying of LGBTQ+ youth occurs, how is it handled by teachers or admins in the school?
        </p>
        <p class="response">
            I don't know that there have been any, like, specific bullying. 'You're gay!' Like, maybe they'll
            say, like, accuse, but no validity to it.
        </p>
        <p class="question"> 
            What kinds of supports are available for LGBTQ youth in your school?
        </p>
        <p class="response">
            Me. -laughs-
        </p>
        <p class="question">
            Okay!
        </p>
        <p class="response">
            There's not anything. Just kids talk to me, and then I ask if they need 
            anything. And then I always will tell another counselor. Like, 'hey, I had a kid say 
            xyz today. Doesn't matter who the kid is. Is there any part of that that I need to share 
            with you?' And they're like, 'Nope.' I'm like, 'Okay. Great.' And then they're fine. I'm like, 
            okay. Sometimes it'll be the opposite, and I'll say to them, like, 'I think this is weird. 
            You should check.' And then they'll just bring them in a small group, and they're like, 
            'Nothing. Not anything about it.' I was like, 'Okay.' And they're like, 'Well, so you're their 
            person. Is that fine?' Like, 'Yep. Fine with me. If anything feels like I don't know how to 
            handle it, I just tell you so then you know? Okay. Great. Super.'
        </p>
        <p class="question">
            Are there any other teachers who are, like, kind of the same as you? Like, students feel 
            comfortable coming out to them?
        </p>
        <p class="response">
            I'm not sure. I think so, but I think that anything that's, like, out of the norm
            everyone just goes to me. But our music teacher is a man, and he is gay. But this is his 
            1st year, and so he is, like, just treading. And I'm like, 'Yeah, man. It's fine. Like, 
            establish yourself as a good teacher, which you are, and then you no one will say anything 
            to you. It's like if you lead with it.' ... So I think, like, eventually, he'll be another person 
            perhaps.
        </p>
        <p class="question">
            Have LGBTQ educators felt safe and supported being out at your school?
        </p>
        <p class="response"> 
            Yeah. I mean, I think so. I mean, now I do. It was not great at first, but then once 
            everyone just, like, pumped the brakes and was like, ‘Oh, she's actually really good at her job!’,
            then everyone just kind of, like, let it go. I don't have to skirt around pronouns as much. Like, 
            kids were saying, like, 'Are you coming to this?' I was like, 'I'm so not. It's Lauren's birthday.'
            'Who's Lauren?' I was like, 'My wife's name. Spoiler, she has one! No, I'm not coming to that.' 
            And they're like, 'Okay.' So they know. Just like, depends on who. You know? I don't lead with 
            it, but, certainly, now I don't feel like I have to skirt around if someone says something.
        </p>
        <p class="question">  
            How are LGBTQ related holidays like pride month acknowledged in your 
            school, if at all?
        </p>
        <p class="response">
            Well, they're not because they're just not. However, it's also in the
            summer, so we're not in school. So we're out by then too, by June. And 
            also no one really talks about it. But, like, I shared with some kids who
            I thought would be interested that there was, like, a pride in Oakland 
            this year, and several kids' families went to it.
        </p>
        <p class="question">
            Okay, my last question is, has there been any parent involvement in
            making your school more or less welcoming of LGBTQ inclusion in schools?
        </p>
        <p class="response">
            Yes. I would say less inclusive. Our bible club that we have, after school...
        </p>
        <p class="question">
            Oh, I didn't know there's a bible club! Okay.
        </p>
        <p class="response">
            ..Uh-huh. Yep. There's a bible club. I think that at first made the kids a little 
            bit odd towards anyone different. But then, awkwardly, one day last year, the room 
            they were using, they couldn't use. And so I was like, ‘You can use my room! It's fine.
            I'm not in there.’ But I just, like, set their stuff up, and I snuck in to get my
            stuff, and the woman who I didn't know was like, 'Kids? I believe we have witnessed 
            our first example of Christ-like behavior today.' And I was like, oh, sweet Jesus wait.
            You have got to be freaking kidding me. She has no idea what's happening right now. 
            And the kids are just like, 'Yeah'. And she's like, 'Well, what did we say? You know, 
            being kind for this and, like, well, miss Jones, let us use her room. She's not a part of our group.
            She, like, set it up for us when we were inconvenienced. That's putting people before yourself. 
            So I'm pretty sure that's what we're looking for here. So thank you!' Now the kids are
            just like, 'What?' And then they stopped being weird. I don't know.
        </p>
        <p class="question">
            Well, that's all my questions. Did you wanna add anything in general?
        </p>
        <p class="response">
            Well, our county actually, at the moment, has a board member that has expressed their 
            disbelief of transgender people. He said, 'Don't even talk to me about trans. That's 
            not real,' on that board. And so I obviously know about law things, I was like, 
            'That is title 9. That's your federal funding. You just broke it.' And so I thought 
            to myself and was like, okay. I'm gonna pursue it. I'm gonna take them out because someone 
            needs to. And then I went to the board meetingm and another board member when they were like,
            'We reviewed the middens for last week.' And he was like, ‘I have an amendment because this 
            person said this, which is the violation of title 9, and I am proceeding with investigations
            on that, so I would like for them to be public that's on the record. He said it, not just 
            on the video and I'm moving forward.’ So there he's, like, investigating, I think, like, 
            within. He is also gay, the other man. 
        </p>
        <p class="question">
            Oh my goodness! wow.

            I know. Getting wild here.
