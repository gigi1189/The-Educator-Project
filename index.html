        <p>
            Thank you for being here! This project was made to analyze the experience
            of LGBTQ+ youth from the perspective of an educator, in the context of outside research
            and studies.

            I interviewed Danielle, a k-8 art teacher in a tiny school in rural 
            Appalachia. I know her from attending her class for a couple of years 
            and staying in touch after graduation, so I am very familliar with the
            school she works in.
        </br>
        </br>
            <span id="about-me">About the interview:</span> It was conducted over a zoom call and has
            roughly 15 questions about the climate of LGBTQ+ students in their school. You can see 
            what questions are required by viewing the full transcript at the top. Everything I asked/said is 
            in red, and Danielle's responses are in black.

           <span id="about-me">About me:</span> Hi, I'm Gigi! Currently, I am studying B.S. 
            in Computer Science at Brooklyn College. I'm apart of the LGBTQ community myself and
            enjoy when I can combine my programming skills with projects on issues that
            I am passionate about. In this case, the fair treatment of LGBTQ+ youth.
